<para>When using the Opal roll by default the frontend becomes the Opal 
server, but it is also possbile to define another node in the cluster so
that it will be used as Opal server.</para>



<para>To this purpose you should firstly deactivate Opal server on the frontend:
</para>
<screen>
 # chkconfig tomcat-opal off
 # /etc/init.d/tomcat-opal
</screen>

<para>
Then you should run insert-ether as described in the Rocks user guide and then 
select Opal Server in the Appliance Type selection menu.</para>

<para>During the installation the machine uses the attribute opal_public_fqdn to 
configure the FQDN that will be used by the opal server.</para>

<para>Otherwise if you have installed the KVM or XEN roll and you want to create a virtual machine to serve 
as an Opal Appliance for your cluster you can run the following commands. Let's say you will run 
your virtual Opal appliance on vm-container-0-0 and you will use one private interface and one 
public intreface (for http traffic):
</para>
<screen>
 # rocks add host vm vm-container-0-0 "Opal Server" num-macs=2
</screen>


<para>Then you should configure the pubblic interface, e.g.:
</para>
<screen>
rocks set host interface subnet opal-server-0-0-0 eth1 public 
rocks set host interface ip opal-server-0-0-0 eth1 169.228.41.222
</screen>

<para>Afterward you should define the opal_public_fqdn attribute for the pubblic interface
</para>
<screen>
rocks set host attr opal-server-0-0-0 opal_public_fqdn nbcr-222.ucsd.edu
</screen>

<para>To start the installation run:
</para>
<screen>
rocks start host vm opal-server-0-0-0
</screen>

<para>In 15/20 minute you opal appliance should be up and running.
</para>
